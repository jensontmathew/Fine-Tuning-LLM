# AI Model Fine-Tuning with Gradient AI

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained AI model using Gradient AI's platform. In this example, we'll use the Gradient AI library to fine-tune a base model and then generate responses to custom queries.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the Gradient AI library installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install gradientai
